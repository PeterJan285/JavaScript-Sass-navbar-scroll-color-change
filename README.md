## Welcome! 👋

- Here I practice making a functional navbar which changes colors as you scroll down the page and it returns to it's default color when coming back up to the top.

### Languages and features 👨‍💻 

- JS: conditional statements, classList add, remove and toggle.
- SASS: mixins, nesting, responsive page, media queries. 

Thanks for checking out my projects.
